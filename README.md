cfd scheme development using model equations

Here are some old CFD exercises.  

-a set of several different discretization schemes
-a Burgers solver using Newton's method to completely resolve the nonlinearity within each time step.
-An Euler quasi 1D solver using an implicit update.
-An Euler quasi 1D solver using Newton's method to completely resolve the nonlinearity within each time step.

Yes it's quite true they could use some tlc to break things up into bite size blocks.
I am working on that as part of a larger plan to build up a 2D unstructured Euler HRSC solver.
